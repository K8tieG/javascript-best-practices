1. Keep variable and function names short and readable
2. Think of your code as a narrative and make it readable line by line
3. Avoid using global variable names so that subsequent scripts using th same variable names do not overwrite your variable/function
4. Declare and initalize variables at the top to avoid late declaration and to provide easier access should any need to be tweaked later on
5. Build modular, specialized functions. When desinging functions, consider a single tasks that you'd like it to accomplish and write it to complete only that task.
6. Comment your code often
7. Avoid mixing with other technologies. Don't add in styling options via Javascript that should be handled by CSS
8. keep code modularized and specialized. Write smaller, generic helper functions that fulfill one specific task rather than catch-all methods
9. Allow for congiguration and translations- everything that is likly to change in your should shoud not be scattered throughout your code
10. Recognize and remove duplicate code to reduce visual clutter
